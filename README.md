# TokaiHunter
Second PJATK Gamejam project

Yokai Hunter is a fast-paced game where you fight off hordes of demons. It's a FPS roguelike game. In the game you play as a Yokai hunter. Your goal is to defeat all demons that stand in your way. Each time you clear a room of demons you get to choose one of the two special powers. Each special power has it's positive effect, as well as a negative one. You will have to choose wisely and decide which power will be more useful to you.

”Yokai Hunter ” was a game made during the 24-hour Game Jam organized by The Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Warsaw. Out of the 100 contenders taking part in the competition, our team was the one that won the gamejam! The theme of the gamejam was: "Inconvenient superpowers". That's why all of the in-game superpowers have some kind of drawback effect.



Each time you play you will encounter a different dungeon as well as different enemies. Rooms that you fight in, are procedurally generated and enemies spawn randomly. Apart from that each time you will have to choose between different superpowers. They are also randomly generated!

Yokai Hunter is a game prototype that we might expand in the future. Currently it's in a alpha stage and it's only a demo of the game. You might encounter some bugs when playing.
